            <p>My dearest Sarah Naeem,</p>
            <p>I can’t believe it’s been <b>1000</b> days. <b>1000</b> days and <b>1000</b> nights. Even one hundred thousand words couldn’t capture 
                my love for you, but with only <b>1000</b> words, I will try to give you <b>1000</b> reasons why you are one in <b>1000</b><sup><b>1000</b></sup>. 
                From the moment I met you, I’ve felt <b>1000</b> feelings every single day. My heart knew you were someone special. 
                I had never seen a girl like you, nor imagined I would ever have the honor to call you mine. You bring joy, love, 
                and warmth into my life in ways I never imagined possible. Every day I’ve spent with you in love is a day that I 
                wish I could relive for eternity, and every day we spend together feels like a dream I never want to wake up from… 
                and every day our future holds together is a day that couldn't come a moment sooner. </p>
           
            <p>I will love you for a lifetime and beyond. Through every season, every change, every challenge, I will love you. Neither 
                <b>1000</b> years, nor <b>1000</b> kms, nor any circumstance could ever change what I feel for you.</p>
            <p>Until our next <b>1000</b> days-</p>
                
        </div>
        <div class="signature">Yours always and forever, <br> A<b>thousand</b>nas Munshi</div>
