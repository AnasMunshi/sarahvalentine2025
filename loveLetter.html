        <div class="content">
            <p>My dearest Sarah Naeem,</p>
            <p>I can’t believe it’s been 1000 days. 1000 days and 1000 nights. Even one hundred thousand words couldn’t capture 
                my love for you, but with only 1000 words, I will try to give you 1000 reasons why you are one in 10001000. 
                From the moment I met you, I’ve felt 1000 feelings every single day. My heart knew you were someone special. 
                I had never seen a girl like you, nor imagined I would ever have the honor to call you mine. You bring joy, love, 
                and warmth into my life in ways I never imagined possible. Every day I’ve spent with you in love is a day that I 
                wish I could relive for eternity, and every day we spend together feels like a dream I never want to wake up from… 
                and every day our future holds together is a day that couldn't come a moment sooner. </p>
            <p>Your smile is the sun that brightens my darkest days.. Our first kiss I still cherish to this very day. Even though 
                it felt like it took 1000 years, the moment felt like it could last 1000 centuries. When our tongues first came 
                together in that hidden closet at prom, it felt like I was exploring the world, and every beautiful thing that I 
                could ever discover all at once. Sometimes I feel like saying “Nothing will ever come close to that feeling” 
                - yet everytime we kiss I get to relive that moment all over again.</p>
            <p>Over the 1000s of moments we have had together, I cherish every moment we spend together, every conversation, every 
                shared look, and every gentle touch, and every inside joke with you. From befriending you, to being your dingermon, 
                to coming all the way down from Moose Jaw with my unique accent, I could name 1000 different inside jokes we have 
                developed over the last 1000 days. </p>
            <p>Though we have our disagreements, through the 1000s of challenges that we face, your love remains my anchor. Your 
                love is the warmth I feel around my body when I press the seat warmer in the -1000°C winters we have. Your love 
                is the feeling of waking up and realizing it’s the weekend. Your love is the feeling of finding out Kira and Near
                made it home on their own. Your love is the morning alarm that I actually don’t mind waking up to. Your love is 
                the London fog or steep tea that never burns my tongue but is always just right. Your love is the extra seasoned 
                A&W fries at the bottom of the bag when I thought they were all gone. Your love is the notification that says, 
                "Package delivered," when I’ve been waiting all day and I channel your spending addiction. Your love is all of the 
                beautiful feelings that I couldn’t experience in a 1000 years, yet I get to feel every single one just by being around you.</p>
            <p>Each time I doze off into a daydream, I am reminded of all the little things that make you so extraordinary. The way 
                you laughat my silly jokes days after I explain them to you, or the way you slap your arm across my chest when you are
                going 1000 km/h.The way you hold my hand when I feel uncertain, or the way your eyes sparkle when you talk about 
                something you are passionateabout. The way you get moody or grumpy when I tease you too much, or the way you hide your
                smile when I make a joke when you’re mad at me. The way your head slowly tilts up the harder I kiss your cheeks, or the
                way you redden up when I bite your ears. These moments are treasures, each one etched into my heart forever, with my 
                heart getting bigger the more I learn and take inspiration from you, so that I can etch at least 1000 more moments 
                for the rest of our lives.</p>
            <p>Over the last 1000 days, I have found myself falling in love with you all over again. Every single day that I wake up to
                my picture of you on my wallpaper, everytime I look at my butterfly phone case. Everytime I catch myself staring at that
                polaroid you gave me in our first month of dating, of you on your living room couch. I am reminded of your irreplicable 
                beauty. Even 1000 artists couldn’t capture something as simple, yet astonishing as your facial structure. Your kindness,
                your intelligence, your strength, and your compassion inspire me to be a better person. You are my best friend, my 
                confidant, my bunny, and my one and only love.</p>
            <p>As I write this, I realize that no words can truly capture the depth of my feelings for you…. However, I hope that you 
                can feel how hard I try to express them in every hug, every kiss, every face rub, every chin beard poke, and every 
                whispered 'I love you.' I vow to cherish you, to honor you, and to love you for all my days. No matter where life takes us,
                know that my heart will always belong to you. Even in 1000 different universes, I will always be yours.</p>
            <p>Loving you has been the most purposeful challenge and greatest adventure of my life. Through our 1000s of arguments and
                disagreements, I have learned 10s of 1000s of things. Yet the one thing I will never truly learn, and will always strive
                to understand better, is how to love you best. It is something I never want to become complacent with, and with each 
                anniversary passing, I hope to acquire a greater understanding of how to love you best.</p>
            <p>I will love you for a lifetime and beyond. Through every season, every change, every challenge, I will love you. Neither 
                1000 years, nor 1000 kms, nor any circumstance could ever change what I feel for you.</p>
            <p>Until our next 1000 days-</p>
